                <h2>Psalms 53:1 - The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they,
                    and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.</h2>
                This is probably the most quoted verse when discussing Athiesm.  The problem with 'claiming' to
                be an Athiest is that there factually is no such thing as a true Athiest.  To be an Athiest you would
                have to know everything.  No knowledge would be unknown to you basically making you a god yourself.  And
                since it is basically impossible for any person one (human) to know everything then you cannot possibly
                'know' that God does not exist.  You have 'Faith' that there is no God.  Proving that Athiesm is by
                ANY definition a religion since it takes faith to believe there is no God.  Even if your the smartest
                person that ever lived (other than Jesus), you cannot possibly know that there is no God.  <br /><br />
                I see videos on Youtube all the time of some athiest trying to prove there is not God by calling
                out to God to prove He exists (something He has already done) yelling for God to appear before them
                right then and there.  Sorry but God obey's NO man/woman/person.  God wants us look at akk the proof
                that He has already left for us and to have faith that He exists.  And before you start screaming.
                Having faith is God is also a religion.  We do not require God to make some great jesture to prove
                Himself when He already has, many times over. <br /><br />
                <br /><hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br />
                The more science discovers, the more proof of God is revealed.  DNA proves the existance of, as the
                scientists put it, a great designer, or someone/something that wrote the code of DNA and in life itself.
                Well isn't that God? Of course it is, they (Athiests) just do not want to admit there is a God because
                then they would have someone/something that they have to answer to ultimately.  Athieses want to believe/
                feel that they are the god of their own life. That they answer to no-one/nothing.  Well the good news for
                them is that they are in control of their life.  They can decide every step, every path that they take.
                Everyone is free to decide for themselves weither they believe in God or not.  There really is no 'proof'
                that there is no God while there is a plethera of proof that God does indeed exist.  Scientific proof.  The
                best thing to do here is let you decide for yourself. DO NOT let others pressure you or brow beat you into
                believing one way or the other, do the research for yourself with an open mind and an open heart and I
                firmly believe that you will come to the same realization that I did, there really and truly IS a God out
                there and He loves you with a perfect love, agope love.  You will accept that He did indeed become man, walked
                among us, died on the cross for us - paying the price for OUR sins since He led a truly sinless life.  The only
                person to ever do this.

                <h2>Proverbs 12:15 - The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.</h2>
                Most athiests have a very closed mind and will not listen to any evidence of God's existance.  They do not
                want to listen or see anything that proves them wrong when it comes to their belief, their faith.<br />
                They do not even want to accept the fact that their belief IS a religion.  They cannot prove God does not exist,
                so they follow the oldest and weakest form of debate.  They attack the messanger instead of the message because
                they cannot prove the message wrong.  The more science discovers the more proof of God and the less proof of
                evolution they find.  Not one point of evolution can be proven, not one.  Carbon dating does not work, in fact none
                of the supposed forms of dating anything scientifically work.  They are guesses at best and 99% of the time they are
                wrong.  How can a dinosaur bone dats at 25,000 years old but the skin date at 35,000 years old? Especially when you
                consider dinosaurs supposedly dies out in the last ice age millions of years ago.  Human bones found in marked graves
                hundreds of years old have already started turning back to dust.  How then can the bones of dinosaurs that are supposed
                to be millions of years old still exist.  Would not they have turned back to dust or become fossilized by now?  Science
                speaks for itself, the proof in the existance of God is in everything. <br /><br />
                I am not even asking you to just take my word for it. Research for YOURSELF and discover the truth for yourself, but
                you MUST first open your mind and your heart or you will never learn the truth.
                <br /><hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br />
                <h2>Proverbs 18:2 - A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</h2>
                Some athiests delight in their belief that there is no God.  They raise or puff themselves up with 'self-glory' professing
                that they are pervayors of truth. That only their truth matters and anyone that thinks different from them are wrong and
                suffering from a mental illness.  If you so much as hint that you might believe something different you will see their entire
                personality change.
                <br /><hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br />
                <h2>Proverbs 18:6 - A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</h2>
                Athiests love to argue and contend with anyone that believes in God.  They di not like to debate, as i stated earlier,
                when they debate they attack the messenger instead of trying to debate the message.  This is because they know in their hearts
                that they cannot 'disprove' the existance of God.  Some have argues that athiests just lask faith, which is not correct.
                Athiests have plenty of faith in their own beliefs.  They cannot prove evolution anymore then they can God does not exist.
                So instead they will argue endlessly.  Even if they are proven wrong they will continue to argue the point they were proven
                wrong on.  They just love to argue
                <br /><hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br />
                <h2>Proverbs 18:7 - A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.</h2>
                They do not reallize or accept the fact that they are destroying themselves with their believs.  It is not their 'life'
                that really matters in the end, it's their Soul.  Everyone lives forever.  Not this caporal short lived life here on hearth
                but everyone's Soul lives forever.  God says He has a new body for each and everyone of us that believe in Him and accept
                Him as our our Lord and as our Savior.  It is we ourselves that will decide where that eternity will be, Heaven or Hell.
                These are reall places and you will spend eternity in one or the other, and unlike many songs and poems, hell is NOT a place
                of partying and endless 'fun'.  Hell is a place of endless pain and suffering.

                <h2>Pro_23:9 Speak not in the ears of a fool: for he will despise the wisdom of thy words.</h2>
                Gos warns us not to 'argue' with athiests, all this will do is result in anger and striff. Debate them yes, argue with
                them ... definately NO.

                <h2>Mat_14:31 And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith,
                    wherefore didst thou doubt?</h2>
                Just as believing in God requires faith, so does not believing in God require faith.
                <br /><hr /><br />
                <h2>Mat_17:20 And Jesus said unto them, Because of your unbelief: for verily I say unto you, If ye have faith as a grain
                    of mustard seed, ye shall say unto this mountain, Remove hence to yonder place; and it shall remove; and nothing shall be
                    impossible unto you.<br />
                    Mat_21:21 Jesus answered and said unto them, Verily I say unto you, If ye have faith, and doubt not, ye shall not only do
                    this which is done to the fig tree, but also if ye shall say unto this mountain, Be thou removed, and be thou cast into the
                    sea; it shall be done.</h2>
                Faith in the right things can accomplish a great many things.

                <h2>Mat_23:23 Woe unto you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for ye pay tithe of mint and anise and cummin, and have
                    omitted the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy, and faith: these ought ye to have done, and not to leave the
                    other undone.</h2>

                <h2>Mar_5:34 And he said unto her, Daughter, thy faith hath made thee whole; go in peace, and be whole of thy plague.
                    Mar_10:52 And Jesus said unto him, Go thy way; thy faith hath made thee whole. And immediately he received his sight, and followed Jesus in the way.
                    Mar_11:22 And Jesus answering saith unto them, Have faith in God.
                    2Co_5:7 (For we walk by faith, not by sight:)</h2>
                <h3>231 verses about Faith.</h3>
                <br /><hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br />
                Just as 'Faith' is required to believe in God, to believe that God does indeed exist, 'Faith' is also required to
                believe in athiesm, to believe that God does not exist.  Every 'self claimed' athiest must have faith in their belief
                that God does not exist since there is no way that they can prove that God does not exist.  Standing there demanding
                that God appear before you or prove to you that He exists, besides being completely crazy, is one of  the weakest and
                lamest method to try to prove ANYTHING much less the existance of God.  Why would ANY 'God' jump to the "demands" of
                those whom He created just to prove to them that they are wrong in their belief, their faith, that He does not exist.
                This, by its definition, makes atheism a religion since it requires faith.  Have no fear however, God has already
                promised that one day He will indeed prove Himself to EVERYONE.  Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess
                that God does indeed exist.  That He is who He says He is and He did everything that He said He did in his story, the
                Bible.  After all, history is HIS STORY.  I pray with all my heart that before that great and terrible day comes, when
                you must kneel before Him, that you do indeed put your faith and your belief in God.  If not, well, it will be too late
                for you on that day.<br /><br />

                Everyone will live forever, its here that we choose our eternal 'address'.  Either in Heaven with God, where Jesus went
                to make a Mansion for you, or forever in Hell, in a lake of eternal fire and endless punishment.  This is not where God
                wants to send anyone. He created Hell for the angels that rebelled against Him, but He has to have somewhere to send all
                those that refuse to trust or to believe in Him.  He sent Jesus to earth to prove that He still loves us and that He does
                indeed exist.  He told them clearly and plainly that He is God and to provide a path back to Him that requires so very
                little on our part.  Jesus did all the hard work for us. He performed many miracles, raised the dead, cured diseases and
                so very many other things while He was here just to show us that He is real, He does live and He still loves us despite
                all the wrong we do.  All the sins we commit on a daily basis.<br /><br />

                There are so many facts that must be dismissed to 'choose' not to believe in God.  With every new scientific discovery,
                more and more proof of God is revealed.  It is a virtual impossibility that man "evolved" from anything.  Believe in the
                facts and in the evidence, God does exist and He does love you even with your doubt. God would that NONE are lost. God
                wants us all to have faith in His existance and in His love for us.
