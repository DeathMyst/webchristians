                <p><em>Psalms 53:1 - The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they,
                    and have done abominable iniquity: there is none that doeth good.</em></p>
                <p>This is probably the most quoted verse when discussing Athiesm.  The problem with 'claiming' to
                    be an Athiest is that there factually is no such thing as a true Athiest.  To be an Athiest you would
                    have to know everything.  No knowledge would be unknown to you basically making you a god yourself.  And
                    since it is basically impossible for any person one (human) to know everything then you cannot possibly
                    'know' that God does not exist.  You have 'Faith' that there is no God.  Proving that Athiesm is by
                    ANY definition a religion since it takes faith to believe there is no God.  Even if your the smartest
                    person that ever lived (other than Jesus), you cannot possibly know that there is no God.  <br /><br />
                    I see videos on Youtube all the time of some athiest trying to prove there is not God by calling
                    out to God to prove He exists (something He has already done) yelling for God to appear before them
                    right then and there.  Sorry but God obey's NO man/woman/person.  God wants us look at akk the proof
                    that He has already left for us and to have faith that He exists.  And before you start screaming.
                    Having faith is God is also a religion.  We do not require God to make some great jesture to prove
                    Himself when He already has, many times over. <br /><br />

                    The more science discovers, the more proof of God is revealed.  DNA proves the existance of, as the
                    scientists put it, a great designer, or someone/something that wrote the code of DNA and in life itself.
                    Well isn't that God? Of course it is, they (Athiests) just do not want to admit there is a God because
                    then they would have someone/something that they have to answer to ultimately.  Athieses want to believe/
                    feel that they are the god of their own life. That they answer to no-one/nothing.  Well the good news for
                    them is that they are in control of their life.  They can decide every step, every path that they take.
                    Everyone is free to decide for themselves weither they believe in God or not.  There really is no 'proof'
                    that there is no God while there is a plethera of proof that God does indeed exist.  Scientific proof.  The
                    best thing to do here is let you decide for yourself. DO NOT let others pressure you or brow beat you into
                    believing one way or the other, do the research for yourself with an open mind and an open heart and I
                    firmly believe that you will come to the same realization that I did, there really and truly IS a God out
                    there and He loves you with a perfect love, agope love.  You will accept that He did indeed become man, walked
                    among us, died on the cross for us - paying the price for OUR sins since He led a truly sinless life.  The only
                    person to ever do this.  </p>

                <p><em>Proverbs 12:15 - The way of a fool is right in his own eyes: but he that hearkeneth unto counsel is wise.</em></p>
                <p>Most athiests have a very closed mind and will not listen to any evidence of God's existance.  They do not
                    want to listen or see anything that proves them wrong when it comes to their belief, their faith.<br />
                    They do not even want to accept the fact that their belief IS a religion.  They cannot prove God does not exist,
                    so they follow the oldest and weakest form of debate.  They attack the messanger instead of the message because
                    they cannot prove the message wrong.  The more science discovers the more proof of God and the less proof of
                    evolution they find.  Not one point of evolution can be proven, not one.  Carbon dating does not work, in fact none
                    of the supposed forms of dating anything scientifically work.  They are guesses at best and 99% of the time they are
                    wrong.  How can a dinosaur bone dats at 25,000 years old but the skin date at 35,000 years old? Especially when you
                    consider dinosaurs supposedly dies out in the last ice age millions of years ago.  Human bones found in marked graves
                    hundreds of years old have already started turning back to dust.  How then can the bones of dinosaurs that are supposed
                    to be millions of years old still exist.  Would not they have turned back to dust or become fossilized by now?  Science
                    speaks for itself, the proof in the existance of God is in everything. <br /><br />
                    I am not even asking you to just take my word for it. Research for YOURSELF and discover the truth for yourself, but
                    you MUST first open your mind and your heart or you will never learn the truth.</p>

                <p><em>Proverbs 18:2 - A fool hath no delight in understanding, but that his heart may discover itself.</em></p>
                <p>Some athiests delight in their belief that there is no God.  They raise or puff themselves up with 'self-glory' professing
                    that they are pervayors of truth. That only their truth matters and anyone that thinks different from them are wrong and
                    suffering from a mental illness.  If you so much as hint that you might believe something different you will see their entire
                    personality change.</p>

                <p><em>Proverbs 18:6 - A fool's lips enter into contention, and his mouth calleth for strokes.</em></p>
                <p>Athiests love to argue and contend with anyone that believes in God.  They di not like to debate, as i stated earlier,
                    when they debate they attack the messenger instead of trying to debate the message.  This is because they know in their hearts
                    that they cannot 'disprove' the existance of God.  Some have argues that athiests just lask faith, which is not correct.
                    Athiests have plenty of faith in their own beliefs.  They cannot prove evolution anymore then they can God does not exist.
                    So instead they will argue endlessly.  Even if they are proven wrong they will continue to argue the point they were proven
                    wrong on.  They just love to argue</p>

                <p><em>Proverbs 18:7 - A fool's mouth is his destruction, and his lips are the snare of his soul.</em></p>
                <p>They do not reallize or accept the fact that they are destroying themselves with their believs.  It is not their 'life'
                    that really matters in the end, it's their Soul.  Everyone lives forever.  Not this caporal short lived life here on hearth
                    but everyone's Soul lives forever.  God says He has a new body for each and everyone of us that believe in Him and accept
                    Him as our our Lord and as our Savior.  It is we ourselves that will decide where that eternity will be, Heaven or Hell.
                    These are reall places and you will spend eternity in one or the other, and unlike many songs and poems, hell is NOT a place
                    of partying and endless 'fun'.  Hell is a place of endless pain and suffering.</p>

                <p>Gos warns us not to 'argue' with athiests, all this will do is result in anger and striff. Debate them yes, argue with
                    them ... definately NO.</p>
