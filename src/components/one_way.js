                <h2>John 14:6 - Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: <br />no man cometh unto the Father,
                    but by me.</h2>
                <h6>Unlike what many so called religious leaders teach and preach, there is only one God.  There are many
                    gods (small g gods), anything you put above God would be considered a god. Money, material things, sex,
                    your time.  All these things could be counted as gods if your putting them before God, if they are more
                    important to you that God is.  Since there is only one God, Jesus says that there is only one way to
                    that God, which is through Him, Jesus the Christ.  He is the ONLY way to get to God.  No man comes unto
                    the father but through Him.<br /><br />
                    Some preachers teach that if you lead a good life, helping others, giving to the poor, tithing to them
                    religiously, things like that, that you can also make it to Heaven/God.  This is a lie straight from Satan.  God says in Titus 3:5 -
                    'Not by works of righteousness which we have done, but according to his mercy he saved us, by the washing
                    of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghost;'.  NOT BY WORKS are we saved, no matter how righteous the
                    works. You must go through Jesus.  Ephesians 2:8 'For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not
                    of yourselves: it is the gift of God:' - It is the free gift of God that we are saved by trusting and
                    believing in Jesus the Christ.  Not of yourselves, not by works alone are you saved!</h6>

                <hr width="80%" color="bisque" />
                <h2>Matthew_7:13/14 - Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction,<br />
                    and many there be which go in thereat: Because strait is the gate, and <br />narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few
                    there be that find it.</h2>
                <h6>While it is simple to get into Heaven, it is not easy by any means.  Simple in that all you have to do is believe in Jesus
                    and His works/words.  Believe that He is who He says He is and that He did what He said He did.  But great is the temptation.
                    Many will fall by the wayside being tempted by this world, by the flesh, by Satan himself.  Many will still believe that they
                    can work their way to Heaven, which they cannot.  Narrow is the path that leads to salvation.  While works alone cannot get
                    you into Heaven, works are necessary as well as believing in Jesus.  Faith without works is dead.  Faith in Jesus will by
                    itself guide you to 'want' to do works.  This is how you show your faith in Jesus, by serving Him in whatever area He has called
                    you to. Some are called to lead and to preach, some are called to be policemen or firemen to serve their communities, some are
                    called to be doctors and nurses.  Some are called just to give a helping hand to the needy, the forgotten.  </h6>

                <h2>Matthew 13:4 - And when he sowed, some seeds fell by the way side, and the fowls came and devoured them up:<br />
                    Matthew 13:19 - When any one heareth the word of the kingdom, and understandeth it not, then cometh the wicked one, and
                    catcheth away that which was sown in his heart. This is he which received seed by the way side.</h2>
                <h6>God's Word, Jesus, will be spread around the world, no matter how hard Satan tries to stop it.  It will be
                    spoken by every tribe, every nation and every tongue.  It has almost reached that point already, time truely is
                    short. Even though God's Word will be spread around the world, much of it (some think most of it) will fall by
                    the wayside and bear no fruit.  That before the word has a chance to sow and grow, the wicked one, Satan, will come
                    and snatch it away, like in China and Russia, which are lead by men that want to be considered gods themselves.<br /><br />
                    This is where works comes in.  Works, even though they do not really feel like work, shows others the Love God
                    has for each and every one of us.  When the seed in us is sown, it grows and produces fruit that can then be used
                    to show others the light of God.  Matthew 5:16 'Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good
                    works, and glorify your Father which is in heaven.'  We do not do works to glorify ourselves but to glorify God.
                    Let the seed in you grow.  Nourish and feed it every day with the Word of God so that it will grow and feed others
                    as well.</h6><br /><br />

                <h2>Mark 12:32 - And the scribe said unto him, Well, Master, thou hast said the truth: <br />for there is one God; and there
                    is none other but he:</h2>
                <h2>Romans 3:30 - Seeing it is one God, which shall justify the circumcision by faith, <br />and uncircumcision through faith.</h2>
                <h2>1st Corinthians 8:6 - But to us there is but one God, the Father, of whom are all things, and we in him; <br />and one Lord
                    Jesus Christ, by whom are all things, and we by him.</h2>
                <h2>Ephesians 4:6 - One God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</h2>
                <h2>1st Timothy 2:5 - For there is one God, and one mediator between God and men, the man Christ Jesus;</h2>
                <h2>James 2:19 - Thou believest that there is one God; thou doest well: the devils also believe, and tremble.</h2>
                <h6>There are many verses in Scripture that tell us that there is only One God.  While that God has many names,
                    ALL His names carry the same message.  So if someone is teaching anything other than what is clearly taught in
                    Scripture, they are teaching about a different god all-together.  Budda is Not God, Allah is not God, the god that
                    the Catholics teach about is not God.  The god that the church down the street teaches about, the god the is ok with
                    same sex marriage or is ok with abortion is NOT the One True God!!! God clearly in His word is against these things, no
                    matter how politically incorrect saying these things are, what matters is what God thinks, what God teaches clearly in
                    His Word, the Holy Bible.  God says that He is the same yesterday, today and forever, He changes NOT.  Meaning what
                    was an abomination to Him 5000 years ago is STILL an abomination to Him today and will be tomorrow also.  Much of this
                    we will cover more in depth in other areas.</h6>
