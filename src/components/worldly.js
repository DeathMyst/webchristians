            <h2>How the World See's Religion</h2>
            <hr width="80%" color="bisque" />
            <h6>At last count there were over 4,500 DIFFERENT religions world wide.  Many claim to have the same
                God.  The problem with this is there is only ONE God and He has already given us our instructions, the
                Holy Bible.  The last chapter of the Bible tells us: <br /><br />

                <h2>Revelation 22:18 For I testify unto every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book, If
                    any man shall add unto these things, God shall add unto him the plagues that are written in this book:<br />
                    Revelation 22:19 And if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God shall
                    take away his part out of the book of life, and out of the holy city, and from the things which are
                    written in this book.</h2><br /><br />

                We are not to add to or take away from the Word of God, the Holy Bible.  Some, many, religions claim to
                have been visited by an Angel of God, claiming to be Micheal or Gabriel, and that these angels gave them
                even more "words from God".  Why would God give a commandment not to add too the Holy Bible and then send
                an angel with more words of scripture?  He Would not do such a thing.<br /><br />
                Personally, I have no doubt in the claims of these men, that an angel appeared to them and gave them more
                words claiming that they were from God.  Who is the father of deception, the father of lies and deciept?
                It was Satan that appeared to these men and gave them different words, words that even contradicted God's
                word and set men against men and has caused so many wars over the years.  Who would do something like that?
                Who would want to cause confusion and striff in the Body of Christ? Satan of course.  I guess when your on
                the outside of these religions looking in, it is so painfully clear what exactly is happening.  I mean, who
                wouldn't want to be able to claim that an angel of God visited them and gave them special information, new
                information from God Himself.  Who would not want to believe that?  But God would not cause striff and
                confussion within His own body.  God wants all men to come together under one faith, under one Book, under
                just one God. The creator of ALL.<br /><br />

                What religion/faith did Jesus Himself setup when He walked the earth?  It was a faith that would walk, talk,
                live and love as He did.  Live the example He Himself gave us to live.  A faith where all men worked together
                in the Body of Christ to lead all peoples to salvation in Him, in Christ.  He did not come to create muultiple
                religions, but to spread ONE faith, one belief.  There is only one God so there should be only one relition,
                yet there are over 4,500.  Satan has done his work well.<br /><br />

                You cannot get to Heaven by works, you cannot 'be a good person' and gain entrance to Heaven.  There is only
                ONE way to get into Heaven and thats through the ONE true God.  All these religions that teach works, or the
                ability to get to Heaven by doing good things, good works, is wrong and not of God.  All these religions that
                teach to hate anyone not of that religion is wrong and not of God.  God is LOVE and wants us to love each other
                NO MATTER the faith or belief.  You cannot win someone to Christ by hating them or "their kind" no matter what
                that 'kind' might be.  We are to love ALL MEN (all peoples regardless of gender, race, religion). We are to pray
                for our firends AND for our enemies.  We are to bring them the true Word of God and try to help them understand
                all that God wants from and for them.  Not beat them over the head with it, not try to force it down their throats,
                not try to forcably get them to believe as you do, even if what you believe is true and correct.  Win them over
                with love and patience.  <br /><br />

                Many religions teach even to kill people that refuse to believe as they do.  Why would God make such a command?  He
                wouldn't.  This is why Jesus taught patience and love, taught us to pray for ALL others.  It would only be Satan
                that would want you to kill someone else before they had a chance to hear and accept the true Word of God.  Satan
                that does not want the true Word of God brought to anyone, he would that we all die in our sin without knowing the
                love God has for each one of us.  Satan is the father of lies, he wants that none follow God.  This is the confusion
                that having so many different religions causes in the world. Too many people think 'what is it I am supposed to
                believe?' and they go through life without ever knowing the true Word of God.<br /><br />

                Look how many 'celebrities' create their own religion because they don't want to follow the true Word
                of God.  They do not want to believe that God has provided a way back to Him, instead they want to have
                a way where THEY can work their way into Heaven by doing good things for other people, giving then a new
                car or some other "prize".  Unfortunatly for them, that's not how it works, you cannot work or buy your
                way into Heaven no matter how many prizes or how much money you give away.  You MUST trust in Jesus and
                repent from your sins to get into Heaven, thats the ONLY way.<br /><br />

                Get yourself a King James Version (KJV) Bible and read for yourself.  Don't take anyone elses word for it, just
                take God's OWN Word for it.  Many studdies have shown that the KJV is one of the easiest versions of the Bible
                for people to read, even among 6th graders.  Read it with an open mind, with patience and you will see for yourself
                that NO other book is needed to know God's plan for YOU.  To know why it is God created you in the first place.  It
                is ok to ask for advise and for others opinions as to what something might mean, but ALWAYS verify what they are
                telling you with Scripture!  The more you read, the more you study, the more you will come to an acceptance of
                Christ and the more you will know, there is only ONE true religion and 4,499 plus religions created by Satan to
                generate striff and confusion in the Body of Christ.<br /><br />

                Only the Holy Bible dates back to over 5000 years ago.  The Book of Morman is less than 200 years old, the Koran is
                less than 600 years old.  God wants all men to come together under one faith not under thousands of faiths.  Trust in
                the Book that was written by God Himself over 5000 years ago and has been RIGHT on everything it has predicted so far.
                NO other book can make that boast, make that claim.  Only the Holy Bible, the KJV version that was translated from the
                original texts themselves.  No other "holy" book can make that claim.  Only the Holy Bible.  Even these "new versions"
                of the Bible have made changes that change the entire doctrine of the scriptures.  They are NOT the Word of God when
                they changea or remove entire verses of scripture.<br /><br /></h6>

            <h2>John 3:16 For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, <br />that whosoever believeth in him should not
                perish, but have everlasting life.</h2>
            <hr width="60%" color="bisque" />
            <h6>This verse has been changed the most in all these new versions.  It says the only Begotten Son for a reason.  Jesus IS
                the only Begotten Son of God but not the only son of God.  Other verses tell us that 'now are ye become the sons of God.  We
                can all become sons (small s) of God by trusting and having faith in Jesus the Christ.  Scripture is very clear on this matter,
                it is the whole path to salvation, becomming the sons of God.  Remember, in Heaven there are no sexes, we are not given in
                marriage there are we are here. So when God says now are ye become the sons of God, now you are a new creation, a new creature,
                it refers to both sexes, male and female. We become the "adopted" children of God.</h6><br /><br />
