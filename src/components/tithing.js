                <hr width="90%" color="bisque" />

                <h6>“Oh no here comes another Christian talking about money again.” <br /><br />
                    That’s how most of us think when the topic of tithing comes up. Tithing is from the Old Testament.
                    However, beware of legalistic churches that require tithing to keep salvation. You are not "required"
                    to tithe in order to keep your salvation.<br /><br />  Salvation is a seperate gift from God and once
                    given He does NOT take it back.  Once saved, always saved.  Once you truely accept Jesus as your Lord
                    and Savior, your saved, its a done deal.  It belongs to YOU and God will never even try to take it back.
                    Also beware of churchs that require to sign "Tithing" agreements where they can automatically take 10%
                    to 15% of your pay before you even get it.<br /><br />
                    This is NOT Biblical. Your supposed to give with a cheerful heart, not because someone twists your arm
                    and coherses you into giving. </h6><br />

                <h6>There are even some that will kick you out if you aren’t tithing. Usually these type of churches
                    pass around the offering basket like 5 times in one service. This is a red flag that you should
                    leave your church because it is unbiblical, greedy, and manipulative.<br /><br />
                    There is nowhere that says that tithing is a requirement, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t give.
                    All Christians should tithe with a cheerful heart and I will give you 13 reasons why.</h6>

                <h6>“God doesn’t need us to give Him our money. He owns everything. Tithing is God’s way to grow Christians.”  Adrian Rogers<br /><br />
                    “Tithing isn’t about God needing your money, it’s about Him needing first place in your life.”<br /><br />
                    “Wise people know that all their money belongs to God.” – John Piper<br /><br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    1. Tithe to store up treasures in Heaven instead of hoarding things on Earth.<br /><br />
                    Matthew 6:19-21 Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth, where moth and rust doth
                    corrupt, and where thieves break through and steal: But lay up for yourselves treasures in
                    heaven, where neither moth nor rust doth corrupt, and where thieves do not break through
                    nor steal: For where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    2. Tithe to trust God with your money. There are many false teachers that will try to use
                    Malachi to extort people, beware! You are not cursed if you don’t tithe. Malachi teaches us
                    to trust the Lord with our finances.<br /><br />

                    Malachi 3:9-11 You are under a curse—your whole nation—because you are robbing me. Bring the
                    whole tithe into the storehouse, that there may be food in my house. Test me in this,” says
                    the Lord Almighty, “and see if I will not throw open the floodgates of heaven and pour out so
                    much blessing that there will not be room enough to store it. I will prevent pests from devouring
                    your crops, and the vines in your fields will not drop their fruit before it is ripe,” says the
                    Lord Almighty.<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    3. Tithe in thankfulness to God because it is God that provides for us and He is the one that gives
                    us the ability to make money.<br /><br />

                    Deuteronomy 8:18 You must remember the LORD your God, for he is the one who gives ability to get wealth;
                    if you do this he will confirm his covenant that he made by oath to your ancestors, even as he has to this day.<br /><br />

                    Deuteronomy 26:10 And now, O LORD, I have brought you the first portion of the harvest you have given
                    me from the ground.’ Then place the produce before the LORD your God, and bow to the ground in worship
                    before him.<br /><br />

                    Matthew 22:21 They say unto him, Caesar’s. Then saith he unto them, Render therefore unto Caesar the things
                    which are Caesar’s; and unto God the things that are God’s.<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    4. To put God first.<br /><br />

                    Deuteronomy 14:23 Bring this tithe to the designated place of worship–the place the LORD your God chooses
                    for his name to be honored–and eat it there in his presence. This applies to your tithes of grain, new wine,
                    olive oil, and the firstborn males of your flocks and herds. Doing this will teach you always to fear the
                    LORD your God.<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    5. To honor the Lord.<br /><br />

                    Proverbs 3:9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the best part of everything you produce.<br /><br />

                    1 Corinthians 10:31 So whether you eat or drink or whatever you do, do it all for the glory of God.<br />

                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />

                    6. Tithe to discipline yourself. To keep yourself from being greedy.<br /><br />

                    1 Timothy 4:7 But have nothing to do with worldly fables fit only for old women. On the other hand,
                    discipline yourself for the purpose of godliness.<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    7. Tithing gives you joy.<br /><br />

                    2 Corinthians 9:7 Every man according as he purposeth in his heart, so let him give; not grudgingly,
                    or of necessity: for God loveth a cheerful giver.<br /><br />

                    Psalm 4:7 You have given me greater joy than those who have abundant harvests of grain and new wine.<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    8. A biblical church helps people in need. Tithe to help others.<br /><br />

                    Hebrews 13:16 And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased.<br /><br />

                    2 Corinthians 9:6 But this I say, He which soweth sparingly shall reap also sparingly; and he which soweth
                    bountifully shall reap also bountifully.<br /><br />

                    Proverbs 19:17  The one who is gracious to the poor lends to the LORD, and the LORD will repay him for his good deed.<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    9. Jesus likes that the Pharisees tithe, but He does not like that they forget the other things.<br /><br />

                    Luke 11:42 “But woe to you Pharisees! For you tithe mint and rue and every herb, and neglect justice and the
                    love of God. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others.”<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    10. God will bless you. I’m not talking about the prosperity gospel and there are different ways that He
                    blesses people. He blesses those expecting nothing in return not those who give but have a greedy heart.<br /><br />

                    I’ve witnessed times where people who complained about tithing and remained stingy struggled and people who
                    cheerfully gave were blessed.<br /><br />

                    Proverbs 11:25 A generous person will prosper; whoever refreshes others will be refreshed.<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    11. Tithing is a way of making sacrifices.<br /><br />

                    Psalm 4:5 Offer right sacrifices, and put your trust in the Lord.<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    12. To advance God’s Kingdom.<br /><br />

                    1 Corinthians 9:13-14 Don’t you know that those who serve in the temple get their food from the temple, and
                    that those who serve at the altar share in what is offered on the altar? In the same way, the Lord has
                    commanded that those who preach the gospel should receive their living from the gospel.<br /><br />

                    Numbers 18:21 I give to the Levites all the tithes in Israel as their inheritance in return for the work they
                    do while serving at the tent of meeting.<br /><br />

                    Romans 10:14 How, then, can they call on the one they have not believed in? And how can they believe in the
                    one of whom they have not heard? And how can they hear without someone preaching to them?<br />
                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    13. Tithing shows your love for the Lord and it tests where your heart is at.<br /><br />

                    2 Corinthians 8:8-9 I am not commanding you, but I want to test the sincerity of your love by comparing
                    it with the earnestness of others. For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was
                    rich, yet for your sake he became poor, so that you through his poverty might become rich.<br /><br />

                    Luke 12:34  Wherever your treasure is, there the desires of your heart will also be.<br />

                    <br /><hr width="90%" color="bisque" /><br />

                        <h2>How much should I tithe?</h2>
                        <hr width="25%" color="bisque" /><br />
                    </center>
                    It depends! Some people give 25%. Some people give 15%. Some people give 10%. Some people give 5-8%.
                    Some people are able to give more than others. Give as you are able and give cheerfully. This is
                    something that we all must pray diligently about. We must ask the Lord, how much do you want me to
                    give? We must be willing to listen to His answer and not our own.<br /><br />

                    James 1:5 If any of you lacks wisdom, you should ask God, who gives generously to all without finding
                    fault, and it will be given to you.</h6>
