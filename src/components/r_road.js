                        that does not belong to you. You never wanted what your neighbors have, that new car, the renovation
                        of their kitchen.  You were always content with all that you have, never wanting more.  You never
                        lusted after that cute boy or girl.  Remember, Jesus said that all you have to do to be unrighteous
                        is think it in your mind and you are unrighteous in the sight of God.</h6>

                        exist in the world today and we stumble and fall over them daily. Only one person has ever lived a

                        death at some point in our life. What God is talking about here is Spiritual death. What spiritual death is
                        is eternal and permanent seperation from God Himself.  What God is talking about here is immediate seperation
                        from God in Heaven, what God is talking about here is you will NOT be able to live out eternity in Heaven with
                        Him, you will spend eternity seperated from Him in the one place where He doesnt want anyone to go, and that's
                        Hell.  Yes Hell is a real place.  God did not create it for us, He created it for the Angels that rebelled
                        against Him and followed Lucifer. But God cannot 'indwell' with sin, and if you are unrepentanted from your
                        sins, you cannot dwell with God, you must be seperated from Him for all eternity.<br /><br />
                        (B) The good news here however is that God has already paid that wage for you if you will only accept it.  It
                        is free to anyone that wants it, all it requires on your end is Faith.  Faith that God is who He said He is, that
                        He did what He said He did.  Trust in that Faith, repent from your sins and ask God to forgive you of your
                        sins and to bring you to Heaven when you die.  Thats it, it really is that simple.  God paid the price for you.

                        love.  No matter what we do God still loves us. God would that NONE were lost, it is not His wish that any
                        of us are seperated from Him for eternity.  He would prefer it if everyone would have Faith in Him.  If we
                        would all trust in Him and repent from our wicked ways.  Even those that are enemies of God and worship Satan,
                        if they would repent and trust in Him, God would forgive them their sins and take them to Heaven when they
                        die.  There is only one unforgivable sin, and that is to deny the Holy Spirit Himself.  If you deny that the
                        Holy Spirit is, and that He did everything He said He did, then God will not, can not, forgive you your sin
                        and take you to Heaven.  Those that think they are athiest, many of them openly deny the Holy Spirit.  They
                        are lost forever in their sin.  For we are justified by His blood, not by our own.  You cannot 'work' your way
                        to heaven, you can only get there by trusting in Jesus, that He paid the wage for your sin already when He shed
                        His own blood on the cross FOR YOU and for me.</h6>

                        are a sinner.  Ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins you SHALL be saved. Scripture specifically
                        tells us that you SHALL be saved, not might be, not may be, not could be.  You SHALL be saved.
                        You can know 100% for sure that if you confess your sins with your mouth (repent), that if you
