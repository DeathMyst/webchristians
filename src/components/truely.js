                <h2>Matthew 7:21/27  Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven;
                    but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven. (22)  Many will say to me in that day, Lord,
                    Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many
                    wonderful works? (23)  And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work
                    iniquity. (24)  Therefore whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken him unto
                    a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: (25)  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the
                    winds blew, and beat upon that house; and it fell not: for it was founded upon a rock. (26)  And every one
                    that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not, shall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his
                    house upon the sand: (27)  And the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon
                    that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.</h2>

                A great many people believe that they are saved and going to Heaven when they die, but this could not be
                further from the truth. Unfortunately there are far far too many churches out there teaching wrong things,
                such as how to get to heaven.  There is only one way to get to heaven and its not through good works, its
                not through tithing every week, its not through genuflecting and repeating the same prayers over and over
                again.<br /><br />
                You can be sure that your truely a Christian if you have trusted in Jesus Christ, if you believe what He
                teaches us and you feel a desire, a passion for helping and loving others.  You want to do good works to
                serve your fellow mankind and to serve your one true God.<br /><br />
                I have already had many accuse me that I was somehow judging them.  Thats NOT me talking to you, thats the
                Holy Spirit trying to convict you and show you that your just not right with God yet.  Stop listening to
                preachers that preach to itching ears.  They want to preach in a way that pleases their congrigation rather
                than in a manner that pleases God.  They want to make sure that tithing keeps coming in.  Any preacher or
                minister that pays himself more than he really needs is not serving God, they are serving themselves.  God
                does NOT want His shepards living in luxury while there are so many homeless, so many living in the streets,
                not knowing where their next meal is going to come from.  I heard one TV-evangelist trying to raise money so
                he could get his SIXTH airplane. Are you kidding me?!?!?  This is in NO WAY serving God.  You should be on
                commercial flights where you can talk to the people and witness to those that might be lost, NOT so that you
                can fly in comfort.  These preachers/ministers are getting their rewards here on earth and will be very very
                suprised when they get to heaven that there will be little to no riches waiting for them there.  It is also
                not a good example to show others.  They will think chasing after money is ok.  Remember, the LOVE of money
                is the root of ALL evil.  Its not money we should be seeking for ourselves, its souls we should be seeking
                for God.  You cannot do that living high up in your mansion that most people cannot even get into to talk to
                you because of all the security guards you have.  Your supposed to be out among the people witnessing to them,
                not hiding in your ivory towers.<br /><br />
                You can know in your heart if your truely saved, if your truely a Christian.  You have a desire to serve others
                in one mannor or another.  Its tough today to know if that homeless person your giving that twenty dollars to is
                really spending it for food or for drugs, but God knows what is in YOUR heart.  He knows your trying to serve
                others with your actions.  So just pray over that twenty dollars and ask God to touch the heart of the person
                your giving it to that that person will see God's light in you and as a result will use that money for food.  Pray
                over that money WITH the person your giving it to to plant the seeds of God in their heart.<br /><br />
                Serving others, serving God will not seem like its a chore, like its something you have to do.  It should beel
                like a blessing. You should love doing it and look forward to every opportunity to serve God in whatever manner
                that He calls you to. <br /><br />
                While going to church every time the doors are open, it is very difficult to do in this day and time when so many
                people have to work on the days most churches are open.  God tells us that we should not forsake the assembling of
                ourselves together with the saints.  We should look for other Christians to "hang out" with.  This way we help each
                other to study and understand God's Word. Always be on the look out for a good church that has services at a time
                that yuo can attend and one that teaches the Word from the Bible, not from their own opinion or not to those with
                itching ears.  God's Word is plain and easy for anyone with the Holy Spirit (someone that has accepted Jesus Christ
                as their one Lord and Savior) to understand.  If your stuck on a verse or don't understand something, pray over it,
                God will reveal it unto you in His time.<br /><br />
                On that great and terrible day, when we all stand before Jesus on the day of judgement, unfortunately so very many
                will be expecting to go to Heaven, but Jesus will say to them, depart from me for i never knew you.  Check your heart,
                do you love helping others regardless of their situation or circumstances?  What if they are dirty and smell bad? Would
                you still help them?  Would you still love them?  God is Love and we are all called upon to love each other and to help
                each other.<br /><br />
