            <h2>1Co 14:27-28 If any man speak in an unknown tongue, let it be by two, or at the most by three, and that by course;
                and let one interpret. (28) But if there be no interpreter, let him keep silence in the church; and let him speak
                to himself, and to God.</h2>
            <h6>When the Bible says 'Speaking in tongues' it means speaking in another language, a language that is not normally spoken
                by the speaker.  For example, I only speak English. If I all of a sudden started speaking in Spanish or Russian, THAT is
                speaking in tongues. It is NOT some unknown language that nobody else knows or some Angelic language that only Angels and
                a few select humans speak.  God is NOT the arthor of confusion, most people if they walked into a Church or another building
                where the main speaker or many speakers were all speaking in some unknown language and there was not interpreter they would
                turn around and walk right out.  That does NOT further the mission of Christ. That only confuses others and causes them to
                walk away from the message.  God is the same yesterday, today and forever, He changes NOT.</h6>

            <h2>Mar 16:17 And these signs shall follow them that believe; In my name shall they cast out devils; they shall speak with
                new tongues;</h2>
            <h6>They shall speak new tongues, or new languages that they have never spoken before. NOT that they would speak some unknown
                language that nobody else knows or some Angelic language that only television preachers and evangelists claim to speak.</h6>

            <h2>Act 2:4-11 And they were all filled with the Holy Ghost, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them
                utterance. (5) And there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven. (6) Now when this
                was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own
                language. (7) And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these which speak Galilaeans?
                (8) And how hear we every man in our own tongue, wherein we were born? (9) Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the
                dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia, (10) Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in
                the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers of Rome, Jews and proselytes, (11) Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak
                in our tongues the wonderful works of God.</h2>
            <h6>This story in scripture clearly explains what speaking in tongues is, it's speaking in a KNOWN language, not in an unknown
                language.  Each person from a different country heard and understood the Apostles understood them in their own language from
                their home country, not some unknown angelic language. Speaking in tongues IS a gift of the Holy Spirit but it is only the
                ability to learn and know many languages at one time.  There are people out there that speak many different languages, this
                is the gift that the Holy Spirit and in EVERY case where there are those that do not speak that.those language(s) there will
                always be an interpreter to help others understand what is being spoken. It is a language, not just gibberish. <br />
                There are those that teach that that is how you can know if your saved or not, that you will be able to speak in tongues. Nothing
                is further from the truth.  You can KNOW that your saved if you have repented your sins and trusted in Jesus Christ, thats ALL that
                you need to do to be saved, speaking in tongues has nothing to do with it.  Satan can use people speaking in gibberish to fool many
                into believing that they have some special power given them by God and that that makes them special in some way.  God would not do
                this. Even when Christ lived among us He did NOT try to elevate Himself above others and He would not allow the Disciples to do so
                either.  One of the disciples mother asked for her sons to sit on the right and left hands of Jesus in Heaven and Jesus would not
                allow that, He told them that those seats were not his to give away, that only God can decide who sits on His right and left sides.<br />
                Speaking in gibberish is not speaking in tongues, this is not a gift from the Holy Spirit. God wants you to know what the Preacher
                or speaker is saying. He doesn't want you confused wondering what is even going on.</h6>
