                <h2>Increasing Corruption on Earth</h2>
                <h2>Gen 6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, <br />
                    and daughters were born unto them,<br />
                    Gen 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; <br />
                    and they took them wives of all which they chose.<br />
                    Gen 6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: <br />
                    yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.<br />
                    Gen 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, <br />
                    when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them,<br />
                    the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.<br />
                    Gen 6:5 And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, <br />
                    and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.<br />
                    Gen 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.<br />
                    Gen 6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth;<br />
                    both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that <br />
                    I have made them.<br />
                    Gen 6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.<br /></h2>
                <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" />
                In this story from scripture many try to teach that the "sons od God" were the fallen angels that fell when
                Lucifer fell and that they took the "daughters" of men to be their wives.  To get the truth about this you must
                study ALL scripture.  When you do so you will see that the sons of God refers to the line of Seth, those that stayed
                true to God and His teachings.  The daughters of men refer to those of the line of Cane, those that fell away from
                God and sought their own will's.<br /><br />

                God says that 'At no time have I ever called an angel my son'.  This verse alone tells us that in no way were
                these sons of God angels.  They had to be human men.  God also teaches us that in Heaven there is no such think
                as marriage, there is no need for different sexes as we do not reproduce in Heaven.  So from this we can also
                infer that the Angels are 'sexless' or genderless.  Unable to reproduce therefore there is no way they can
                be with women and create these nephilim much less create even a human child.<br /><br />

                When searching for truth or for the meanings behind any verse you must use Scripture to prove Scripture.  Do NOT
                try to just make up your own belief or "truth" without verifying it with other Bible teachings. However, lets for
                a moment assume that they were angels.  It would not matter since every living thing that was not on the Ark died.
                So if there were any nephilim, which there was not, they all would have died in the flood anyways.  But Scripture
                CLEARLY teaches us that there are no such thing as nephilim.  Angels are genderless and therefore unable to have
                any children.  God did not create them to have any children. They were unable to.<br /><br />

                <h2>Reference Verses</h2>
                <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br /><br />
                <h2>Hebrews 1:5 'For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee?
                    And again, I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?'</h2><br /><br />
                God NEVER called an Angel His son, not ever.<br /><br />
                <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br /><br />
                <h2>Job 1:6 'Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also
                    among them.'</h2> <br /><br />
                These were HUMANS that came to worship God and present themselves to God.  Remember your early Bible. God was more
                directly involved with humans back them.  Before the Flood. As more and more men, humans, drew away from God, God
                withdrew more and more from man. However, the line of Seth still followed God and still presented themselves before
                God regularly.  Satan, an Angel, just happened to come with them this time and presented himself before God as well.
                Satan had a mission and wanted to try to prove something to God that not all men followed Him (God).  Also, the way
                God set things up is that the man is the head of the house and responsible for the family.  A man could be called a
                son of God but a woman would be a saved through the man, i.e. their father or their husband if they were married.
                All women at that time, and even today, would be considered the daughters of men unless the man of the household still
                followed God. Then the woman would be a child of God through the man, the father or the husband.  <br /><br />

                <h2>Job 2: 1 'Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD.'</h2> <br /><br />
                <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br /><br />
                <h2>Job 38:7 'When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy?'</h2> <br /><br />
                <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br /><br />
                <h2>John 1: 12 'But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on
                    his name:'</h2><br /><br />
                Believe on His name, the name of Jesus the Christ.  Then will you become a son of God. NOT AN ANGEL, humans do NOT become
                angels when they die, that would be a demotion.  When we die, if we are saved, we go to Heaven to be with God, to rule with Him
                for all eternity.  Angels will serve us. They will help us to rule and to reign with God forever and ever amen.  Just speculation
                here but even with the population on earth as high as it is, there are enough planets out there that God can give every human
                ever born a trillion planets and STILL not give out every planet out there. How would you like to rule and reign over a trillion
                planets.  Just being in Heaven with God for all eternity would be enough for me, but to rule and reign with him for all of
                eternity would just be a bonus.  What? did you think we would just sit on clouds for all eternity? Nope, God has plans for
                each and every one of us even in eternity.<br /><br />

                <h2>Romans 8:14 'For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God.'</h2> <br /><br />
                When you are saved, the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God indwells you and guides/leads you.  Thats the
                moment you become a Son of God, when you accept Jesus and trust in Him, now are you become a son of God. <br /><br />
                <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br /><br />
                <h2>Romans 8:19 'For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God.' </h2><br /><br />
                Scripture teaches us that once your saved, once you have trusted in Jesus, 'Now are ye become the sons of God',
                'now are you become a new creature, a new creation'.  <br /><br />
                <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br /><br />
                <h2>Philippians 2:15 'That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world;'</h2> <br /><br />
                <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br /><br />
                <h2>1 John 3: 1-2 'Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is.'</h2> <br /><br />

                <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" /><br /><br />
                There are many more verses in scripture that prove beyond doubt that fallen angels did not procreate with human
                women to produce these 'nephilim'.  God never called any Angel His son, ever.  The 'sons of God' are the human
                line of Seth, the line that still believed in and followed God and His teachings.  God truely is NOT the author
                of confusion, He would not leave any doubt, and He didn't.  The nephilim, if they existed, are not the offspring
                of angels and human women.  Remember, back thousands of years ago human genes/dna was much purer than it is today.
                Giants would be nothing back then, expecially before the flood, when there was a dome of ice all around the world
                creating a double atmosphere in the world, making growing much easier.  A tweleve foot tall man or woman would be
                commonplace back then, and they would be totally HUMAN.  We are not "evolving', we are 'devolving'.  We are becoming
                more and more 'diluted' with each passing generation. Further and further away from the perfect gene that God created
                when He created Adam and Eve.  There are far more birth defects today than there were hundreds or even thousands of
                years ago.  Most of what some consider 'Nephilim' were nothing more than very tall or very big humans, which we even
                have today, just not as often and not as big.<br /><br />
                So again, when trying to make or prove a doctrine or a Biblical teaching, use scripture to verify or prove scripture.
                Do not just take a verse or two out of context and claim that you have some new Bible teaching.  The Bible has been
                scrutinized for centuries now, its very unlikely that ANYONE will come up with something new in scripture.  The idea
                of a 'Nephilim' is something relatively new, only been around for maybe a hundred years or so. Just like many thinking
                that the earth was/is flat, Christians have always known that it was not, that it is round, spherical. Christians have
                known that angels cannot procreate, either among themselves or with a human partner.  Every idea, every thought, every
                doctrine MUST be carefully and thouroughly researched using scripture to veryfy its truth, its validity.<br /><br />

                I am sorry if some of this sounds sexist, masoginist, but thats how God set things up and He has not changed them since
                He set them up.  God is the same yesterday, today and forever, He changes not.
