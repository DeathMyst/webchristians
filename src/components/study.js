                <h2>Increasing Corruption on Earth</h2>
                Gen 6:1 And it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them,
                Gen 6:2 That the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair; and they took them wives of all which they chose.
                Gen 6:3 And the LORD said, My spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh: yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.
                Gen 6:4 There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.
                Gen 6:5 And GOD saw that the wickedness of man was great in the earth, and that every imagination of the thoughts of his heart was only evil continually.
                Gen 6:6 And it repented the LORD that he had made man on the earth, and it grieved him at his heart.
                Gen 6:7 And the LORD said, I will destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth; both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air; for it repenteth me that I have made them.
                Gen 6:8 But Noah found grace in the eyes of the LORD.<br />

                In this story from scripture many try to teach that the "sons od God" were the fallen angels that fell when
                Lucifer fell and that they took the "daughters" of men to be their wives.  To get the truth about this you must
                study ALL scripture.  When you do so you will see that the sons of God refers to the line of Seth, those that stayed
                true to God and His teachings.  The daughters of men refer to those of the line of Cane, those that fell away from
                God and sought their own will's.<br /><br />

                God says that 'At no time have I ever called an angel my son'.  This verse alone tells us that in no way were
                these sons of God angels.  They had to be human men.  God also teaches us that in Heaven there is no such think
                as marriage, there is no need for different sexes as we do not reproduce in Heaven.  So from this we can also
                infer that the Angels are 'sexless' or genderless.  Unable to reproduce therefore there is no way they can
                be with women and create these nephilim much less create even a human child.<br /><br />

                When searching for truth or for the meanings behind any verse you must use Scripture to prove Scripture.  Do NOT
                try to just make up your own belief or "truth" without verifying it with other Bible teachings. However, lets for
                a moment assume that they were angels.  It would not matter since every living thing that was not on the Ark died.
                So if there were any nephilim, which there was not, they all would have died in the flood anyways.  But Scripture
                CLEARLY teaches us that there are no such thing as nephilim.  Angels are genderless and therefore unable to have
                any children.  God did not create them to have any children. They were unable to.<br /><br />

                <h2>Reference Verses</h2>
                Hebrews 1:5 For unto which of the angels said he at any time, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee? And again,
                I will be to him a Father, and he shall be to me a Son?<br /><br />

                Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them. (Job 1:6)<br /><br />

                Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan came also among them to present himself before the LORD. (Job 2:1)<br /><br />

                When the morning stars sang together, and all the sons of God shouted for joy? (Job 38:7)<br /><br />

                But as many as received him, to them gave he power to become the sons of God, even to them that believe on his name: (John 1:12)<br /><br />

                For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, they are the sons of God. (Romans 8:14)<br /><br />

                For the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestation of the sons of God. (Romans 8:19)<br /><br />

                That ye may be blameless and harmless, the sons of God, without rebuke, in the midst of a crooked and perverse nation, among whom ye shine as lights in the world; (Philippians 2:15)<br /><br />

                Behold, what manner of love the Father hath bestowed upon us, that we should be called the sons of God: therefore the world knoweth us not, because it knew him not. Beloved, now are we the sons of God, and it doth not yet appear what we shall be: but we know that, when he shall appear, we shall be like him; for we shall see him as he is. (1 John 3:1-2)<br /><br />
                <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" />
                There are MANY more verses in scripture that prove beyond doubt that fallen angels did not procreate with human
                women to produce these nephilim.  God is NOT the author of confusion, He would not leave any doubt, and there
                is none.  The nephilim, if they existed, are not the offspring of angels and human women.  Remember, back thousands
                of years ago human genes/dnd was mush purer than it is today.  We are not "evolving', we are 'devolving'.  We are
                becoming more and more 'diluted' with each passing year.  There are far more birth defects today than there was
                hundreds or even thousands of years ago.  Most of what some consider "Nephilim" were nothing more than very tall or
                very big humans, which we even have today, just not as often and not as big.<br /><br />
                So again, when trying to make or prove a doctrine or a Biblical teaching, use scripture to verify or prove scripture.
                Do not just take a verse or two out of context and claim that you have some new Bible teaching.  The Bible has been
                scrutinized for centuries now, its very unlikely that ANYONE will come up with something new in scripture.  The idea
                of a Nephilim is something relatively new, only been around for maybe a hundred years. Just like many thinking that the
                earth was/is flat, Christians have always known that it was not, that it is round, spherical. Christians have known
                that angels cannot procreate, either among themselves or with a human partner.  Every idea, every thought, every
                doctrine MUST be carefully and thouroughly researched using scripture to veryfy its truth, its validity.<br /><br />
