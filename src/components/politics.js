            <hr width="80%" color="#EAAC6F" />
            <h6>Today's political environment has created a conpletely UN-Biblical viewpoint on politics and religion.  For
                many years it was illegal for Preacher's to preach about politics in church, something that NEVER should have
                happened, for it is scripture and Biblical teachings that should guide us in our political decisions.  Instead
                we vote strictly along party lines, tribalism.<br /><br />
                There are both good and bad points about any political party but we should not vote one party or another just
                because our family or friends vote that way.  Instead we should not vote with any party just because others
                that we know are doing so, we should seek the guidance of the Holy Spirit.<br /><br />
                We should not vote with any party, for example, that practices anything that is against Biblical teachings.  Vote
                instead for the individual that best represents the teachings of scripture.<br /><br />
                Here is where I will lose many of you but I MUST teach according to scripture.  The Bible is clear, for example,
                when it comes to murder.  Now, do not confuse murder with killing.  While you should not seek tokill anyone, if you
                are defending your family or yourself, scripture is clear on that, you are allowed to protect your family and yourself
                to the point of killing any person threatening your family's safety.  Murder is the taking of a life of an innocent.
                A Baby in the womb is an innocent, EVEN in the case of rape or incest.  The baby did not rape you and incest was
                not a thing until the time of Moses.  The child IS and innocent and taking their life is murder.  You should not
                place your vote to any party that tried to protect this practice, abortion IS murder.<br /><br />
                If your voting to protect a so called 'right' to commit murder, then your voting wrong.  Your voting against the will
                and teachings of God. <br /><br />
                When God created man, it was His desire that we would seek God and God alone to rule over us, but man being man
                sought earthly rulers instead.  So God permitted us to elect rulers over us but we are to seek God's guidance when
                we cast our 'vote'. Its God that raises up and takes down rulers but He permits us to chose our leaders as well.
                It is God's will that only a SMALL group of people rule over us and ONLY in the areas of safety, setting up laws and
                rules to govern over us as guided by scripture, such as thou shall not murder. God warned us that rulers
                being rulers will seek to tax us as much as they can for their own benefit.  Haven't you ever wondered how our
                leaders, our politicians become so rich when their pay is not really that much?  How do they become millionaires
                or multi-millionaires by serving the people?<br /><br />
                We should not be voting for a big government in other words.  What party thinks the bigger the government
                the better for the people?  Its not beter for the people, its better for them, so they can control us better.
                A small government is what God wants for us, a government guided by Him.  It is a false teaching that there is
                supposed to be a seperation of church and government.  What is scriptural is that God guides the government, God
                guides the church, NOT visa-versa. The government is NOT supposed to rule over the church, thats God's domain.  God
                warned us about this as well but like most scripture, it has been twisted by Satan and our government.  This also
                is used to give them more power, which is what government is all about, having power over the people instead of
                serving the people, which is supposed to be their mission.<br /><br />
                I am NOT suggesting that people vote for ANY specific party, just the opposite.  We should research the candidates,
                listen to what they have to say.  See what they have already done if they have been in office for any period of time
                and see how they vote on bills and laws that are used to govern the people.  That means you may vote for some democrats,
                some republicans and even some independents depending on where they stand.<br /><br />
                EVERYONE should actually be declaired as an Independent and vote for the most Christ like candidate. Thats how God wants
                us to vote, but if your voting for a specific political party or person just because your family is Democrat or Republican
                then your doing it wrong and not doing it according to God's teachings.  We learn a lot about how we should "vote" in the
                torah, the first five books of the Bible but we learn a lot from the teachings of Jesus also.<br /><br /></h6>

            <h5>Things you should NOT be voting for according to scripture.</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Abortion.</li>
                <ul>Too many so called Christians just cast their votes "protecting a womans right to choose" but
                    unfortunately for them it's God's choice that counts and God clearly teaches us that life begins at
                    conception, NOT at birth.</ul>
                <ul>You cannot be Christian and support abortion, you just cannot.</ul>
                <li>Large Government.</li>
                <ul>God is NOT for large government, its His will that He rules us, not other men or women.</ul>
                <ul>God warns us over and over again that a large government leads to just one thing, corruption.</ul>
                <ul>The Larger the government the larger the taxes that they collect.</ul>
                <li>Taxation without representation. <br />
                    <ul>Today many taxes are passed without any representation from the people.  Our so called leaders pass these
                        taxes more for their benefit that for the benefit of the people.</ul>
                    <ul>Our taxes pay for our elected officialy childrens college education at the most elite (expensive) colleges
                        in the country, in the world in some cases.</ul>
                    (not just government representation but representation by the people, by popular vote.)</li>
                <li>Anyone that has been in office a long time.</li>
                <li>Anyone that wants to take God's given rights away from you.</li>
                <li>Anyone that wants to limit religion in any way.</li>
                <li>Any politician that has been proven to Lie.</li>
                <li>Any politician getting rich while in office.</li>
                <li>Any politician that thinks there is supposed to be a seperation of Church and State.</li>
            </ol>
