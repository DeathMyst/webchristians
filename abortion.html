        Abortion

    <div class="main-text">
        The main problem with the abortion argument is that too often only one or two verses are 
        used to try to prove a position for or against abortion and how God views this very Important
        topic. Otherwise known as "Cherry Picking".  We must take Scripture as a WHOLE to fully understand
        and appreciate God's perspective and His wishes on any given topic.  You cannot just take two or
        three verses and expect to get God's full perspective. You must think about His full message.
        <br><br>
        The verse listed above, from Job chapter 31, show us that God Himself creates each baby in the
        womb.  These are questions asked of Job pointing out that God makes each and every one of us in 
        the womb and that without Him, God, no child can be created.
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        <i>Exo 21:22-25 - If men strive, and hurt a woman with child, so that her fruit depart from her, and 
        yet no mischief follow: he shall be surely punished, according as the woman's husband will lay upon 
        him; and he shall pay as the judges determine. 23 - And if any mischief follow, then thou shalt give 
        life for life, 24 - Eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25 - Burning for 
        burning, wound for wound, stripe for stripe.</i>
        <br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        These verses are used by both sides of the argument on abortion.  The pro-choice side uses them 
        to try to show that the "fetus" is nothing more than property and therefore can be replaced with 
        a cow or a goat by the offender.  However, when we take more of God's word into account, we see that 
        the man IS held responsibile to the point of death for his wrong in taking the life of an innocent. 
        <br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        Many claim that Abortion is a right given to them in the Constitution of the United States, under the 
        "Live, Liberty and pursuit of Happiness" phrase in the constitution. The problem with that argument 
        isd that abortion was not even a thing at that time in history.  Causing the death of a baby, a fetus, 
        was considered abhorant by the vast majority of the population.  Abortion did not become a mainstay 
        in culture until Margaret Sangert popularized it in the early 1900's for the purposes of exterminating 
        the black race.  Her motivation was totally racist at its core. There is no constitutional provision 
        for abortion. 
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        Today abortion is used as nothing more than a form of birth control and as an excuse to live a lifestyle 
        also not condoned by God. A lifestyle of sexual impurity and immorality.  A lifestyle where having 
        multiple partners, even at the same time, is considered ok. When a single man fornicates with a single 
        woman, God considers those two now married in His sight.  When married people have sex with anyone else, 
        not their spouse, God considers that adultry. Even if all parties agree, God does not agree.
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        Its God that determines when life begins and God tells us over and over in scripture that life begins 
        at conception. God creates that life in the womb and that is why many are now trying to destroy Christianity 
        and any other faith that is against abortion, because the truth is, you CANNOT support abortion and 
        be a Christian at the same time. You just cannot, it goes against God's word. Its not me saying this, 
        its God saying this. Personally for me, God saying it is enough for me, God is against the harming of 
        an innocent in any way, fassion or form.  You cause the death of a little one, and innocent one, one 
        God has blessed you with weither you see it or not, you must pay the price that God set forth in 
        scripture, unless you repent, admit you did wrong and seek forgiveness for your transgression and God 
        is just and faithful to forgive all those that repent in truth.
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        Pray in all earnestness for God to guide you in this matter.  Set aside your own personal wants, your 
        own personal demands or desires.  Let God guide you on this and you will see that God truely is against 
        the killing of innocents in any form or under any name.  Abortion is the murder of the most innocent 
        among us. How many millions of babies must suffer and die just so your sex life is not inconvenienced 
        for a time, or because you feel your life might be desttroyed if you have that baby.  Talk to those 
        mothers that were brave enough to have their babies. The vast majority of them will tell you that 
        their baby is a blessing in their life.  They love that baby unconditionally, just as God loves you, 
        without any conditions.  That is what true love really is.  Its not what you find between the sheets in 
        the throws of passion with someone you might never even see again.

            <center>Verses that Define God’s View of Human Life:</center> 
        </font>
        <hr width="77%" align="center"><br>

        <i>Genesis 1:27 </i>So God created mankind in his own image, in the image of God he created them; male and female 
        he created them.<br><br>
        We are God’s creations made in His image. This gives us inherent and incomparable value. 
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        <i>Psalms 8:4-5 </i> What is man that you are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? Yet you 
        have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor.<br><br>
        
        God sees human life as valuable, honorable, and glorious. 
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        <i>Corinthians 3:16-17 </i> Do you not know that you are God’s temple and that God’s spirit dwells in you? 
        If anyone destroys God’s temple, God will destroy him. For God’s temple is holy, and you are that 
        temple.<br><br>
        
        God created both our souls and our bodies and wants us to treat life as both holy and sacred. 
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        <i>Psalm 139:13-16 </i>“For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother’s womb. I praise 
        you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made. Wonderful are your works; my soul knows it very well. My 
        frame was not hidden from you, when I was being made in secret, intricately woven in the depths of the 
        earth. Your eyes saw my unformed substance; in your book were written, every one of them, the days that 
        were formed for me, when as yet there was none of them.” <br><br>
        
        God was intentional in every aspect of our individual creation. He has a plan and purpose for every human 
        life from conception. 
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        <i>John 10:10 </i> The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life, 
        and have it to the full.<br><br>
        
        God’s definition of life extends well beyond breath in our bodies, God desires for us to live fully 
        and freely in him. This is why at Care Net, we choose to say we’re Pro Abundant Life instead of 
        simply Pro Life. <br><br>
        
        <hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        Of course there are many more passages and verses through scripture that affirm the value of 
        life and God’s desire for us to live an abundant life. What are some of your favorites? Let me know in the 
        comment.
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        <i>Jeremiah 1:4-5 </i> Now the word of the LORD came to me, saying, “Before I formed you in the womb, I knew you, 
        and before you were born I consecrated you; I appointed you a prophet to the nations.”
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        <i>Psalms 22:9-10 </i> Yet you are he who took me from the womb; you made me trust you at my mother’s breasts. On 
        you was I cast from my birth, and from my mother’s womb you have been my God.
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        <i>Isaiah 49:1, 5 </i> Listen to me, O coastlands, and give attention, you peoples from afar. The LORD called me 
        from the womb, from the body of my mother he named my name. . . And now the LORD says, he who formed me 
        from the womb to be his servant, to bring Jacob back to him; and that Israel might be gathered to him—for 
        I am honored in the eyes of the LORD, and my God has become my strength.
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        <i>Judges 13:2-5 </i> There was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. And his 
        wife was barren and had no children. And the angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “Behold, 
        you are barren and have not borne children, but you shall conceive and bear a son.  Therefore be careful and 
        drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for behold, you shall conceive and bear a son.  No 
        razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he shall begin 
        to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines.”
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        <i>Galatians 1:15-16 </i> But when God, who set me apart from my mother’s womb and called me by his grace, was pleased 
        to reveal his Son in me so that I might preach him among the Gentiles, my immediate response was not to consult 
        any human being.
        <br><br><hr width="77%" align="center"><br>
        I know that even after reading all this evidence, there will be many that still will not relent in their belief 
        that abortion is ok. They want to believe this out of guilt, out of loyalty to a political party or because they 
        are just anti-religion. This is more directed at those that claim to be Christians, those that have faith in God 
        and truly want to know his truth.  God truly is against abortion for ANY reason. Its not the childs fault in 
        cases of rape or cases of incest yet it is the child that pays the ultimate price for the fathers wrong-doing. If 
        you dont want the child there is always adoption. Its God that gives life.
